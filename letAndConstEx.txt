<!-- // let and const Exercise
    // In this exercise, you’ll refactor some ES5 code into ES2015.
    
    // ES5 Global Constants
    var PI = 3.14;
    PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!
    
    // ES2015 Global Constants
    // /* Write an ES2015 Version */
    const PI = 3.14;
    // Quiz
    // What is the difference between var and let?
    var can reassig and redeclare it is function scoped, while let  cannot be redeclared and it is block scoped.
    // What is the difference between var and const?
    var can reassig and redeclare,you can not redeclare or reassign using const.const is also block scoped.
    // What is the difference between let and const?
    let allows reassign/does not allow redeclaration
    const does not allow reassign/ does not all redaclaration.
    
    // What is hoisting?
    It’s the way that we explain how the JS compiler works. Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using var, you can access the variable name and it’s undefined value before it is used later on.
    
    Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” they are defined in a codebase. -->
